            <td>CSC 445</td>
            <td>Theory of Computation</td>
            <td><i>In Progress</i> - Still very early in the quarter. Subjects for study include finite state machines, regular languages, context-free grammars, and computability theory. Seems like a lot of cool theory stuff.</td>

            <td>CPE 431</td>
            <td>Programming Languages II (sequel to 430; known as "compilers")</td>
            <td><i>In Progress</i> - Still very early in the quarter, but it looks like we're going to be building a compiler using ANTLR. Running under CSC 400 "Special Problems" class due to lack of 431 being offered anymore, so will be a very individual-work-based class.</td>
