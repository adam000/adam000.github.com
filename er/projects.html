    <p>All of my projects can be found on <a href="http://github.com/adam000">github</a>, but I'll list and describe some of the cooler ones here.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b><a href="http://github.com/adam000/xsera">Xsera</a></b> - A top-down RTS/TPS space shooter. Control your own ship and give commands to other ships to complete objectives like capturing planets or other key locations. Ported from / based on Ares, a game by Ambrosia Software. Though I have been unable to greatly contribute recently, I definitely plan on finishing this project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm looking for other projects that seem to have disappeared from github. I'll post those when I find them.</p>
