    <p>As you're reading this, I'm constructing these pages. Please come back later for a more finished version :)</p>
    <p>This page is here to describe stuff that didn't fit on my resume, but I feel is equally important. This page in particular is just a table of contents.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="classes.html">Classes</a> - Important classes, classes I liked, and Cool Things I did in those classes</li>
        <li><a href="languages.html">Languages I Like / Dislike</a> - What I have a passion for, what languages I'll default to when given the choice, and more</li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects I'm working on or have worked on</a> - Open source! Stuff I do on the side</li>
        <li><a href="setup.html">My Setup</a> - What hardware and software I prefer</li>
        <li><a href="http://githire.com/profiles/adam000">Githire</a> - my rather high Github score (top 5% of githubbers, though I bet that's slightly exaggerated))</li>
    </ul>
