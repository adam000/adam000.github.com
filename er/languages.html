    <h1>Languages I Like / Dislike And Why</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>I thought it would be good to state some of my particular favorite and least favorite languages and briefly explain why I like or dislike them. Please note that "disliking" a language does not mean that I will not work well in that language or that I will drag my feet when using that language; however, such languages would not be the first I would choose when setting out to complete a given task. Also note that these are in no particular order, just grouped by category.</p>
    <h3>Like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>C</b> - A trusty language. I taught myself C in high school when I wanted to learn how to program. Not object-oriented, but it's fast and reliable, because it's been around so long. "Portable assembly" is a nice way of thinking about it, though it's more powerful than just that.</li>
        <li><b>Lua</b> - Lightweight, fast, and simple. Ideal for embedded applications, such as <u>robots / low-powered devices</u> (I am a mentor on the Atascadero Robotics program, and we use Lua on our robot) and <u>games</u> (I, along with a few friends, are working on porting an old game called <a href="http://git.adam0.net/xsera">Xsera</a>). Lua's amazing simplicity makes it a go-to language for a wide variety of project types.</li>
        <li><b>Objective-C</b> - Thinks outside the box. Message passing is a very unique way to think about object orientation, and provides for some interesting challenges and benefits. As I use a lot of Apple hardware, Objective-C makes building simple apps really easy. Since it can be compiled and optimized by a C compiler, it benefits from C's blazing speed as well.</li>
        <li><b>Go</b> - A relative newcomer to my programming toolbox, Go is a language that reimplements C, but better. If C were written today, instead of 30-odd years ago, it would look like Go. The language is set up for multithreading, which is becoming more and more essential for today's applications. Go's syntax is clean and readable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dislike</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Java</b> - Don't get me wrong, Java is useful for a lot of things, but the language is clunky and slow to develop in. On the other hand, it's slow and steady, and I have a plethora of experience with it (most of my Cal Poly major courses use Java). Scalability is also a plus, with packaging that C and Objective-C lack. It's also undeniably widespread.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Like AND Dislike</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ruby</b> - My experience with Ruby in Rails and as a general scripting language is generally positive, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The incompatiblity bbetween minor version numbers seems wrong, but maybe that's just a side effect of its recent rise in popularity. Ruby's minimalistic and simple syntax (and the standard library's naming convention) means that the productivity chokepoint becomes your mind instead of your hands, which is a nice contrast to Java.</li>
        <li><b>Standard ML</b> - Standard ML was my first encounter with purely functional programming, which was really fun. The problem lies in the fact that ML sets up some nice ideas, like currying, but then many of the standard library functions prohibit currying because they require that the elements be passed in as a tuple, instead of individually.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To Learn List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Haskell</b> - From what I've heard and seen, it does functional programming better than Standard ML.</li>
        <li><b>Python</b> - I already know a little bit of Python, but I want to have more extensive knowledge of it.</li>
        <li><b>PHP</b> - I've heard that programmers view it as a not-so-clean language, but learning it would certainly be nice for the web development side of my toolkit.</li>
    </ul>
